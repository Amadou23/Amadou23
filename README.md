### Hello, I'm Amadou N'Gom 👋👨‍💻

 I'm a data scientist with a passion for building better products by finding data-driven solutions. I'm fascinated by the potential that big data offers us and aim to contribute greatly to the world of tech. I thoroughly enjoy working with highly driven thinkers to achieve common goals, and possess a strong affinity for people. Probably querying a database right now... Or playing with Pandas 🐼.
